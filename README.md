# Simple SPA
A simple starter SPA (single page app) built with React and React Router. 

*An assignment I did through MIT, for my* **Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
